# Machine Learning Algorithms with Biomarkers
 
- The purpose of this project is to develop a system to monitor and analyze the response of cancer patients to a new drug using imaging data from CT scans and MRIs collected. The system will help identify patients who would respond positively to the drug, enabling tailored treatment strategies and further research.
